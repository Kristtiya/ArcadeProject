Hello!

Welcome to my Python Snake implementation!

This is a simple game done in 8 hours to challenge myself at programming in Python.

The snake is controlled using W, A, S, D
with ESC being used as an exit button

A reset button was attempted but it became janky, which has to do with how I 
implemented the variables. It will be fixed...eventually XD

Have fun with this simple snake game!
